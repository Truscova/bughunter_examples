## Defining Scope of Project

Our dashboard accepts **Markdown (`.md`) files** to define the scope of blockchain smart contract security reviews.

Please follow one of the **approved formats** when preparing your scope file. We've included working examples in the [`scope_examples`](./scope_examples) directory of this repository for reference.

Copy and paste one of the following blocks into a new file (e.g., `scope.md`) and edit as needed.

### Option A ‚Äì File List

```markdown
- /contracts/Token.sol
- /contracts/Exchange.sol
- /contracts/Wallet.sol
```

### Option B ‚Äì Named Files

```markdown
- Token.sol
- Exchange.sol
- Wallet.sol
```

### Option C ‚Äì File Table with Metrics

```markdown
| File                | nSLOC |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| /contracts/Token.sol | 250   |
| /contracts/Exchange.sol | 180   |
